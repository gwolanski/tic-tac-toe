# tic-tac-toe

The title says it all: This is my rendition of the classic game of tic-tac-toe. This project was completed as part of The Odin Project (TOP) curriculum. The project directions can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe

Something that I've learned from my projects, to date, is that game logic can be quite difficult. In theory, explaining how these games work is easy. But turning that into logic is where the real test is. This project required quite a bit of trial-and-error, but was a great growth opportunity for my JS skillset.

Tools used: 
-DOM manipulation
-Objects
-Factory functions
-Immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)
